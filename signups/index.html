  </ul>
  <p>
  These practice nights and times depend on the team/coach your child is selected to.  You will not get to determine the practice nights/times.  If you have a night/time your child absolutely cannot practice, please indicate that on your registration form and the league will try its best to accommodate your schedule at the time of the team selection (draft).  Not all accommodations can be met, but as a league we do try to make the program work with other activities/commitments.
  </p>
  <p>
  Each team will play one game on Saturday mornings and they last about 1 hour.  The games are typically scheduled to start at about 8:00am and finish when the last teams play (this depends on the number of teams for each season, but is usually done by noon for girls season and 2PM for boys season).
